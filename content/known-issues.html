<p>All our future work (including improvement and bugs) can be found at Github. However, here are some bigger issues we’re aware of. </p>

<h3>Plug-in closes when you click off</h3>

<p>Explanation: This is the default way Chrome-addons work. We know it doesn’t work well when copying emails though. It’s especially troublesome when the app doesn’t find the article title (combined with the issue 3). </p>
<p>How users can address: Copy an email before you open the app. When the article title isn’t automatically found, write it in. </p>
<p>Fix status: Exploring quick fix, and long term solution </p>

<h3>User fills in all details, story is logged, but request isn’t created</h3>

<p>Explanation: There appears to be an issue with some plug-ins interfering with the Open Data Button. </p>
<p>How users can address: Disable other plugins, or use incognito mode. </p>
<p>Fix status: Identifying root issue, and exploring short term fix. </p>

<h3>App records URL every time it’s opened</h3>

<p>Explanation: In Open Access Button, the app recorded a block immediately. The Open Data Button works the same way (didn’t have funding to redevelop). Now, with new features to make requests transparent these hits are much more visible. </p>
<p>How users can address: Be careful when you open the app. You can request a URL is removed at leads@openaccessbutton.org</p>
<p>Fix status: Finishing feature to filter these on our side, exploring longer term fix</p>
