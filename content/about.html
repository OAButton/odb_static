      <p>The Open Data Button is an experimental tool building on the Open Access Button. More information can be found on the main <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/about">Open Access Button</a> website, however we've provided some Open Data Button specific information below.</p>

      <h2>Funding</h2>
      <p>Funding to create the Open Data Button Beta was generously provided by the Centre for Open Science. The Open Society Foundation also provided funding for several essential features of the tool. You can help support the tool by <a href = "https://www.openaccessbutton.org/donate">donating today</a>.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>You will be able to download the Open Data Button on Chrome, and later on Firefox. When you need the data supporting a paper (even if it's behind a paywall), push the Button. If the data has already been made available through the Open Data Button, we'll give you a link. If it hasn't, you'll be able to start a request for the data. Evenutally, we want to search a variety of other sources for it - but can't yet.</p>

      <p>The request will be sent to the author. We know sharing data can be hard and there's sometimes good reasons not to. The author will be able to respond to it by saying how long it'll take to share the data - or if they can't. If the data is already available, the author can simply share a URL to the dataset. If it isn't, they can attach files to a response for us to make available. Files shared with us will be deposited in the <a href="https://osf.io/" target="_blank">Open Science Framework</a> for identification and archiving. The Open Science Framework supports data sharing for all disciplines. As much metadata as possible will be obtained from the paper, the rest we'll ask the author for. </p>   

      <p>The progress of this request is tracked through our new "request" pages. On request pages others can support a request and be sent a copy of the data when it's available. We'll map requests, and stories will be searchable - both will now be embeddable objects. </p>  

      <p>Once available, we'll send data to people who've requested it. You can award an <a href="https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/1.%20View%20the%20Badges/" target="_blank">Open Data Badge</a> to the author if there's enough supporting information to reproduce the data's results.  </p> 

      <p>At first we'll only have a Chrome add-on, but support for Firefox will be available from Firefox 46. Support for a bookmarklet will also be provided, but we don't have a release date yet.  </p>
